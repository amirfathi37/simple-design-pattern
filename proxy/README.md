# Proxy Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Proxy design pattern. The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern used to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object. It acts as an intermediary or a wrapper, controlling access to the real object.

## Proxy Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Proxy design pattern is to provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control its access. It allows for additional functionality to be added before or after accessing the real object, without modifying its code.

### Advantages

1. **Security Control:** The Proxy pattern allows you to add a security layer to control access to the real object, restricting or granting access based on certain conditions.

2. **Lazy Initialization:** The Proxy pattern supports lazy initialization, which means that the real object is created only when it is required, improving performance and memory usage.

3. **Remote Access:** Proxies are also used in scenarios where the real object resides in a remote location, and the proxy can manage the communication between the client and the remote object.

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity:** Introducing a proxy can add complexity to the codebase, especially when dealing with multiple proxies for different purposes.

2. **Performance Overhead:** The proxy might introduce additional processing overhead due to the extra layer of indirection it introduces.
