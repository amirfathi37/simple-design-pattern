# Adapter Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Adapter design pattern. The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern used to make two incompatible interfaces work together. It acts as a bridge between the two interfaces, allowing them to work seamlessly.

## Adapter Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Adapter design pattern is to convert one interface into another so that two incompatible interfaces can work together. It allows objects with different interfaces to collaborate without changing their existing code.

### Advantages

1. **Compatibility:** The Adapter pattern allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together, increasing code reusability and compatibility.

2. **Separation of Concerns:** The Adapter isolates the client code from the complexities of interfacing with incompatible objects, promoting separation of concerns.

3. **Open/Closed Principle:** The Adapter pattern follows the Open/Closed Principle, as it allows for introducing new adapters to support new interfaces without modifying existing code.

### Disadvantages

1. **Overhead:** Introducing an Adapter can add some overhead and complexity to the codebase, especially for simple systems where direct communication might be sufficient.

2. **Design Complexity:** The introduction of adapters might make the design more complex, and excessive use of adapters could lead to code bloat.
