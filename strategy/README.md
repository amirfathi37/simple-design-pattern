# Strategy Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Strategy design pattern. The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. It allows the client to choose the algorithm at runtime without modifying the client code.

## Strategy Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Strategy design pattern is to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate them, and make them interchangeable without the client knowing the details of each algorithm.

### Advantages

1. **Flexibility:** The Strategy pattern allows you to switch algorithms at runtime, making the code more flexible and adaptable to different scenarios.

2. **Encapsulation:** Each algorithm is encapsulated within its own class, promoting clean code organization and separation of concerns.

3. **Open/Closed Principle:** The Strategy pattern follows the Open/Closed Principle, as you can add new strategies without modifying the existing client code.

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity:** Introducing multiple strategies and their classes can increase the complexity of the codebase.

2. **Choosing the Right Strategy:** Selecting the appropriate strategy might require careful consideration based on the application's requirements.
