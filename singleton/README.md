# Singleton Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Singleton design pattern. The Singleton pattern is one of the creational design patterns and is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instanc in this project.

## Singleton Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Singleton design pattern is to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is useful in scenarios where there should be a single shared resource or when multiple instances of the class may cause issues.

### Advantages

1. **Single Instance:** The Singleton pattern ensures that there is only one instance of the class throughout the application, which can be helpful when managing shared resources like database connections or configuration settings.

2. **Global Access:** The Singleton provides a global point of access to its instance, allowing all components in the application to access the same instance without passing references explicitly.

3. **Lazy Initialization:** The Singleton instance can be created only when it is required, providing lazy initialization, which can be beneficial in reducing memory usage and improving performance.

### Disadvantages

1. **Global State:** The use of Singleton introduces a global state in the application, which can make it harder to track dependencies and lead to tight coupling between classes.

2. **Testing Difficulties:** Since Singleton provides a global point of access, it can make unit testing more challenging, as the shared state may lead to unexpected behaviors in test cases.
