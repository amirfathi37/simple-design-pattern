# Decorator Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Decorator design pattern. The Decorator pattern is a structural design pattern used to dynamically add additional behavior or responsibilities to objects. It allows you to extend the functionality of objects at runtime without modifying their code.

## Decorator Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Decorator design pattern is to add behavior or responsibilities to objects dynamically. It provides a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending the functionality of objects.

### Advantages

1. **Dynamic Behavior Extension:** The Decorator pattern allows you to add new functionalities to objects at runtime without modifying their code, making it easy to extend behavior dynamically.

2. **Single Responsibility Principle:** By using decorators, you can achieve the Single Responsibility Principle by separating concerns into individual decorators.

3. **Open/Closed Principle:** The Decorator pattern follows the Open/Closed Principle, as you can introduce new decorators to add functionality without modifying existing code.

### Disadvantages

1. **Complexity:** The Decorator pattern might lead to an increase in the number of classes in the codebase, potentially making it more complex.

2. **Ordering of Decorators:** The order in which decorators are applied can affect the final behavior, and managing the order might become cumbersome in complex scenarios.
