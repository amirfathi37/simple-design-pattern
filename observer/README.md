# Observer Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Observer design pattern. The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern used to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects. When the state of one object changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

## Observer Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Observer design pattern is to establish a dependency relationship between objects. When the state of the subject (observable) changes, all its observers are notified automatically.

### Advantages

1. **Loose Coupling:** The Observer pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject and its observers. Observers can be added or removed without affecting other parts of the system.

2. **Extensibility:** It allows new observers to be added without modifying the subject's code, making the system easily extensible.

3. **Consistency:** Observers are notified immediately whenever the state of the subject changes, ensuring consistency between the subject and its observers.

### Disadvantages

1. **Order of Notification:** The order in which observers are notified might not be predictable, which could affect the behavior of the system in some scenarios.

2. **Performance Impact:** The pattern might introduce some performance overhead, especially when there are a large number of observers.
