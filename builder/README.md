# Builder Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Builder design pattern. The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.


## Builder Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction of complex objects from their representation. It provides a flexible and structured way to create objects with different configurations while avoiding constructor pollution (having multiple constructors with different parameter combinations).

### Advantages

1. **Step-by-Step Construction:** The Builder pattern allows objects to be constructed step by step, making it easy to create complex objects without having a large number of constructors or parameters.

2. **Clear Object Representation:** By separating the object construction logic from its representation, the code becomes more organized and easier to understand.

3. **Variability:** The Builder pattern allows the construction of different representations of the same object by using different builder implementations.

### Disadvantages

1. **Overhead:** The Builder pattern requires creating separate builder classes, which might lead to additional classes and some overhead.

2. **Complexity for Simple Objects:** For simple objects with only a few attributes, using the Builder pattern might be more complex than simply using constructors.
