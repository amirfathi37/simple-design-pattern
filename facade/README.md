# Facade Design Pattern - Simple Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple demonstration of the Facade design pattern. The Facade pattern is a structural design pattern used to provide a unified and simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It acts as a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## Facade Design Pattern

### Intent

The intent of the Facade design pattern is to provide a simple interface to a complex system or a set of interfaces. It hides the complexities of the subsystem and provides a unified interface for the client to interact with.

### Advantages

1. **Simplified Interface:** The Facade pattern provides a simple and easy-to-use interface, shielding the client from the complexities of the underlying subsystem.

2. **Decoupling:** By providing a facade, the client code is decoupled from the implementation details of the subsystem, promoting loose coupling.

3. **Abstraction:** The facade can abstract the complexities of a system, allowing clients to use the system without worrying about internal details.

### Disadvantages

1. **Limited Flexibility:** The facade provides a simplified interface, but it may not expose all the capabilities of the underlying subsystem, limiting the flexibility for advanced users.

2. **Added Layer:** Introducing a facade adds an additional layer between the client and the subsystem, which might introduce some overhead.
